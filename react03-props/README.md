app.jsx → main.jsx → index.html → Browser

This is the execution chain when a React app runs using Vite.


// Browser pehle HTML padhta hai, HTML main.jsx ko call karta hai, main.jsx React ko start karta hai, aur App.jsx screen pe dikhai deta hai.


// what is Component in react.js ? 

-> It is reusable code -> small pieces of code which can be used multiple times in the application. 
Ex : Header, Footer, Button, Card, etc.

-> Components are like JavaScript functions. They accept inputs called "props" and return React elements that describe what should appear on the screen.

-> it return JSX (JavaScript XML) 

-> JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It is used with React to describe what the UI should look like. 

-> JSX = HTML + JavaScript
