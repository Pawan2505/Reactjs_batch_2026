## 6️⃣ Overview of ReactJS

React mainly focuses on:

* Building UI using **components**
* Updating **only the required part** of the page
* Writing **clean and maintainable code**

📌 Important Point:
React is **not a framework**, it is a **library**.
That means we can choose our own tools for routing, state management, etc.

## 7️⃣ Features of ReactJS

### 🔹 1. Component-Based Architecture

* UI is divided into **small reusable parts**
* Example:

  * Header
  * Footer
  * Navbar
  * Card

---

### 🔹 2. Virtual DOM

* React creates a **virtual copy** of the real DOM
* It compares changes and updates **only what is needed**
* This makes the application **fast**

---

### 🔹 3. One-Way Data Flow

* Data flows from **parent component to child component**
* Makes code:

  * Easy to debug
  * Easy to manage

---

### 🔹 4. JSX (JavaScript XML)

* JSX allows us to write **HTML inside JavaScript**
* Makes UI code **clean and readable**

```jsx
<h1>Hello React</h1>
```

---

### 🔹 5. React Hooks

* Hooks allow functional components to:

  * Store data (state)
  * Handle side effects like API calls, timers
* Common hooks:

  * `useState`
  * `useEffect`

---

## 8️⃣ Advantages of ReactJS

### ✅ 1. Reusable Components

* Write once, use multiple times
* Saves development time

---

### ✅ 2. Fast Performance

* Virtual DOM improves speed
* Smooth user experience

---

### ✅ 3. Large Community Support

* Many tutorials and videos
* Easy to find solutions
* Large ecosystem of libraries

---

### ✅ 4. SEO Friendly

* Supports server-side rendering
* Better search engine visibility

---

### ✅ 5. Easy to Learn

* If JavaScript is clear, React is simple
* Learning curve is less compared to Angular
